We studied SARS-CoV-2 genomes from travelers arriving in Hong Kong from November-2021 to February-2022. Apart from detecting Omicron (N=120) and Delta (N=58) variants, we detected a BA.1/BA.2 recombinant virus in two epidemiologically linked cases. This recombinant has a single breakpoint near the 5â€™ end of Spike gene (nucleotide position 20055-21618). 

The analysis in this study can be seperated into two parts (1. searching for recombinants and 2. analysing recombinant), please enter into respective directories for analyzing scripts.
